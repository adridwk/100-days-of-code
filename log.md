### Day 1: June 16, 2021 


**Today's Progress**: Build a tribute site, still in progress.  Build a responsisve module as an assigment for Conquering Responsive layouts .

**Thoughts:** I really struggle with CSS, but it stuck with it today and did not give up.

### Day 2: June 17, 2021 


**Today's Progress**: Finished the tribute site, HTML and CSS and uploaded it to FCC.  Started with my next project.  Learned about github, did a few fork, clone, push, pull request.  Created a Palindrome Checker and practise dom manipulation.

**Thoughts:** Today was better, adding the finishing touches to my project was much easier.  I think it is the design aspect of websites that I find the hardest to do.
