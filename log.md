# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 16, 2021 


**Today's Progress**: Build a tribute site, still in progress.  Build a responsisve module as an assigment for Conquering Responsive layouts .

**Thoughts:** I really struggle with CSS, but it stuck with it today and did not give up.

### Day 2: June 17, 2021 


**Today's Progress**: Finished the tribute site, HTML and CSS and uploaded it to FCC.  Started with my next project.  Learned about github, did a few fork, clone, push, pull request.  Created a Palindrome Checker and practise dom manipulation.

**Thoughts:** Today was better, adding the finishing touches to my project was much easier.  I think it is the design aspect of websites that I find the hardest to do.

### Day 3: June 18, 2021 


**Today's Progress**: I continued to work on my second FCC assignment.  Did not make a lot of progress with the project, the design and content kept me running around in circles. Practised some array methods.  Build a project as part of a training course. Learned more about github and research resources.

**Thoughts:** I got a little derailed by the survey project, finding designs and content I like end up taking too much time.

### Day 4: June 19, 2021 


**Today's Progress**: I completed a few problems on codewars.

**Thoughts:** Took this day to recover, but it was really good to pass a code challenge I struggled with.

### Day 5: June 202021 


**Today's Progress**: Back on the horse, made good progress with my survey for FCC, I found a design and content, all that is left is to style it.  Did a flexbox challenge and build an awesome animated navigation bar as part of a course.

**Thoughts:** I used the Promodoro method to get my design and content, timing each tasks really helped me to stay focused and not go on a rabbit trail.  I will continue to use this going forward.
